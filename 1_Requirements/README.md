Today, there are lots of College and School is present, and it is increasing each day. So, it is become difficult to check the exam copies of each student correctly within the prescribed time. To overcome this problem, we are going to build a Mark sheet generation system which will check the answer copies of the student and also generate the mark card of each student. By use of this system a University, Colleges, and School will get the benefit and can produce the result of students with minimal error and in minimum time. Existing

In the current mark sheet generation system, the University has to spend much time just to arrange the copies of the students. While, after arranging they have to spend the time to get the copies checked and then they produce the result. All this process only consume time and require huge manpower. Each year there is news about some University that copies have not checked correctly. The money that a University spend is large, but the result which comes is not up to the mark and because of this they need some system which can reduce all the problem and can provide the best output.

Proposed system Automation of mark sheet generation will reduce the time to create the marks card of the student. The University only needs to upload the exam copies to the system and then the system will complete rest of the work. This application can check all the papers and can produce the result. The computers are much faster than the human, and hence it will take less time to produce the result. The University management can also change the procedure to produce the result if they want. The automation of mark sheet generation system will not only reduce the time but it will also reduce the cost as the number of the person require is less.

Mark sheet generation Module Admin: The University, college or school management who is responsible for generating the marks sheet will be the admin. They will observe the work process and can stop the system if there are any problem.

Work process: This will consist of upload and check procedure of answer papers. It needs some small group of people who will upload the answer sheets to the system. The admin will select these people.

Result: According to the details provided at the time of upload this system will generate the mark sheet of each student.
